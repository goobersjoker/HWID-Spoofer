# HWID-Spoofer
TraceX is an advanced HWID‑spoofing solution designed to bypass anti‑cheat systems in games (Valorant, Apex Legends, Warzone, Fortnite, and others). The program replaces key system identifiers — disk serial numbers, MAC addresses, BIOS UUID, motherboard and GPU identifiers, as well as EFI boot variables. It includes a full system cleaner that removes traces of gaming activity, browser data, event logs, Xbox and Discord accounts, and network fingerprints. With deep spoofing of CPU, motherboard, and SCSI disk data, plus a built‑in VPN configurator and tools for uninstalling games, TraceX is one of the most comprehensive spoofing solutions available. Compatible with Windows 10/11.
